    In 2012 I began learning Python to increase my productivity as an engineer,
    and have really enjoyed the experience. Prior to 2012 my only exposure to
    programming was a Pascal undergraduate class and using MATLAB in graduate
    school. After reading some articles on Sphinx and watching

    PyCon presentation I decided to create this project that would serve as a
    repository for completed `exercism <http://exercism.io/>`_ problems as
    well as an opportunity to practice programming core skills (
    `version control <http://git-scm.com/>`_,
    `documentation <http://sphinx-doc.org/#>`_,
    `hosting <https://read-the-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>`_,
    `profiling <http://jiffyclub.github.io/snakeviz/>`_,
    `unit testing <http://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/testing.html>`_).
